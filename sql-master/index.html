<h1>SQL Inner Join</h1>
        

<p>
    
 The INNER JOIN (or just JOIN) powerword can be used to select items in two different tables that have matching values. For example, if two tables have the same column id, JOIN will select all the rows in both tables as long as they have that unique column id.

 <h1>Data Scientist </h1>   
    
<p>
        
 A data scientist is someone who uses computational and mathematic tools in order to find information and derive meaning from it for the purpose of communicating it to others. For example, the Cairo readings are aimed towards data scientists because it discusses how to find patterns in data and the best way to visually communicate these trends. This is different than computer scientists who study the process of problem solving.
